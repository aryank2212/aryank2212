# Aryan Kumar

Undergraduate Computer Science student (B.Tech, 2029)  
Focused on **machine learning systems, mathematical foundations of deep learning, and research-grade implementations**.

-- Based in New Delhi, India
-- Happily learning and preparing on **research engineer and Data sciences (international)**  

## Why this GitHub exists

This GitHub documents my my journey of transition from a write to a developer
to a **research-oriented machine learning data science engineer**.

My focus is not on quick demos or library-heavy projects, but on:
- deriving algorithms from first principles,
- implementing them from scratch,
- reproducing published results,
- and understanding *why* systems fail.
- understanding the core concepts.

Most repositories here are have a variety of repositories varying on my needs, some of it are the part of a structured, multi-year research roadmap.
